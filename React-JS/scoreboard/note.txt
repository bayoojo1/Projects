Using Create React App
Why Create React App?

In React Basics, you started to build the scoreboard app using the CDN links to help you focus on learning React, without having to worry about installing and running any tools.

The CDN-based approach is not useful in a production environment as soon as you start using JSX. For instance, we used Babel directly in the browser to transpile JSX into JavaScript. The Babel script is ~800KB in size, which for most use cases, is too large of a download to be practical. Also, there's the overhead in the browser of transpiling JSX into JavaScript.

Developers use compiling as part of a build process to avoid the overhead of downloading Babel and multiple JavaScript files to the client. Create React App sets up a modern build system for your React apps in little time, no need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. The tools are already pre-configured in each new project, that way you can focus on building your app.

To get started, install Create React App and create a new app, at all once, with npx. For example:

npx create-react-app scoreboard
cd scoreboard
npm start

The scoreboard app is already set up for you with Create React App. To get a head start, you can download the project files here.
A closer look at the project files

What's in package.json?
When you create a project with Create React App, it installs the latest version of React and React-DOM, as well as the latest version of react-scripts, a development dependency that manages all other dev dependencies that run, test and build your app.

Progressive Web App Features
Create React App sets up a fully functional, offline-first Progressive Web App by default. However, we removed the PWA related files just for this project to focus on the React components only.
