HOW TO INSTALL EXPRESS

$ npm init -y 

$ npm install express@4.15.2 --save

To keep a nodeJS application running without having to do a restart everytime a change is made, install the nodemon module like so 
$ npm install -g nodemon 
To use it, make sure the package.json file has the "main" field pointing to your app, e.g 
"main": "app.js"
To run it, type nodemon at the command line while in your project directory
